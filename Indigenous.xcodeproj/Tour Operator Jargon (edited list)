*Tour Operator Jargon* (edited list)
I think we should consider following the industry naming conventions:

*Important naming terms* -- _Terms to try to use when naming our variables, classes, files, and folders._
+*Attractions*: An item or specific interest to travelers, such as natural wonders, manmade facilities and structures, entertainment, and activities.

+*Client list*: A printout of the names of all tour participants.
+*Closeout*: Finalization of a tour, cruise, or similar group travel project after which time no further clients are accepted. Any unsold air or hotel space is released, and final lists and payments are sent to all suppliers
+*Costing*: The process of itemizing and calculating all the costs the tour operator will pay on a given tour.
+*Day tour*: An escorted or unescorted tour that lasts less than 24 hours and usually departs and returns on the same day. See sightseeing tour.
+*Departure point*: The location or destination from which a tour officially begins.
+*Destination*: The geographic place to which a traveler is going.
+*Escort*: See tour director. [So stop snickering! :p ]
+*Group leader*: An individual who has been given the responsibility of coordinating tour and travel arrangements for a group. The group leader may act as a liaison to a tour operator or may develop a tour independently (and sometimes serve as the tour director).
+*Guide or guide service*: A person or company qualified to conduct tours of specific localities or attractions.

+*Tour departure*: The date of the start by any individual or group of a tour program or, by extension, the entire operation of that single tour.

+*Tour order*: A voucher given to the purchaser of a tour package that identifies the tour, the seller, and the fact that the tour is prepaid. The purchaser then uses this form as proof of payment and receives vouchers for meals, porterage, transfers, entrance fees, and other expenses. See also voucher.
+*Waitlist*: A list of clients awaiting transportation or accommodations at times when they are not available. Waitlisted clients are confirmed as a result of subsequent cancellations.



*Thought-provoking terms* -- _The fact that these exist implies cool things to keep in mind._
